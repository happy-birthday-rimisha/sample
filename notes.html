							Every moment we spent together holds a special place in my heart,
							be it having our first photoshoot together
							or having hot momos at Why Not Momos and trying to say our names 
							or be it doing 12th class business studies project together or studying together, 
							be it our gossip sessions or crying sessions. 
							From our scooty rides to activa rides 
							or be it trying to keep straight face at anurag sir class to actually want to laugh out loud. 
							All these memories with a lot more means alot to me and will always stay close to my heart. 
							I love you meri jaann😘❤️🫂
							And happiestttt Birthdayyyyy❤️❤️
							Wishing you a life full of happiness, success and loveeee❤️❤️

							Heyy Rimishaa!
							Thinking of the best memory or the best moment we share, i really can't think of any one, there are sooo manyy!😍
							You know I can't even imagine school life without you, there are barely any memories I remember in which you are not there.🥰
							Us sharing that small piece of pencil in KG while writing, to sitting together on the same desk, to going near to the dustbin to talk, to our endless walks during recess in the ground, to our three legged race on sports day😄, there are plenty of them!
							And everything was so funn with you, always stay the same!!!!
							Loveee youu & Wish you a very Happy Birthday!!💝🫂

							The memories we made at MIT are pure gold, I mean the Dive Ghat drive, badminton matches on the fourth floor that were more drama than sport with endless laughter in between. From confidently calling you Rimisha ❌ instead of Ramisha ✔️, Some friendships aren’t built on big talks, but on stupid jokes, shared madness.
							To that effortless best bestie 🥂 cheers.
							Happy Birthday Ramisha!!!🫂

							Happy birthday rimisha didi … you have always had this motherly instinct towards me.. 
							I will always remember how i got sick in the first week itself 
							and i knew literally no one but you… you took care of me like a mother takes care of her child.. 
							and alsoo the day i first came to look for the room you were soo happy i remember being nervous i still wasn’t sure 
							but you were soo sure about me you were soo happy to have me but then aarya came before me and you were shocked and disheartened 😂… 
							When i came for the first time i didn’t even know how to press my own clothes you did it for me… 
							you were like my home away from home i missss you ssooo much i will always be soo grateful to have you in my life… 
							i loveyouuuuu😚❤️❤️
